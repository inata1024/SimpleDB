# SimpleDB
The lab assignments of the course **Database Systems**.
It used to be the homework of [BerkelyCS186](https://cs186berkeley.net/) , [MIT6.830](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-830-database-systems-fall-2010/assignments/).

SimpleDB is a basic database management system writen in Java.
The author have provided a set of 
mostly unimplemented classes and interfaces. You will need to write the 
code for these classes. Your code will be graded by running a set of system 
tests written using JUnit, called **System tests**.
There are also a number of unit tests, which are not used for grading but 
that you may find useful in verifying that your code works.

## About this repository

There are 6 labs in total and I have completed **lab1 ~ lab4**. 
In lab1, I focus on implementing the core 
modules required to access stored data on disk; in future labs, I
add support for various query processing operators, as well as 
transactions, locking, and concurrent queries.

For lab1~lab4, [documents](https://github.com/inata1024/SimpleDB/tree/main/documents) and my [reports](https://github.com/inata1024/SimpleDB/tree/main/reports)(in **Chinese**) are avilable in this repository.
